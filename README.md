# earth2mars (2020, POC)

My first try at remote controlling a robot

I had a Discord bot running on an RPI. It was looking for specific keywords my nieces would write on a specific channel
    Upon recognition, it would transmit instructions to a micropython firmware running on a EV3 LEGO brick through an ssh connexion
    The robot would then move accordingly
    A webcam would then stream a videofeed back to my nieces

I got this idea after participating to [Robot Uprising 2020}(https://robotuprising.fi/), with the goal of making one day a fully crowd-controlled robot
